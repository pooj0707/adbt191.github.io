      <p> 
Hello! I am Poojah and I love creating various art pieces, from abstarct painting to drawing portraits. 
      Before Bootcamp I have not done a lot of coding, I've only learnt the basic commands and looked 
      at a few tutoials but after these two weeks I've been able to create a sketch connected to my love for 
      art.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	As my first programming project, with the knowledge I gained from the past two weeks of Boot camp, 
        I was able to produce a piece revolving around the usage of variables such as floats and exploring
        different designs with the help of random numbers. Firstly, I needed a background of black flowing 
        lines to help with the dripping paint illusion, for that the Gaussian Random Number helped a great deal.
        With that in place, I was able to control the width of the strokes with strokeWeight() as well as  
        implementing random colours to the background by implementing random into background(), to an illusion 
        of dripping paint requires more colours, hence the changing in colour within every loop.
